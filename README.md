# Neverending poem
## What is this?
The neverending poem is a website where everyone can write a poem together.
No signing up, no other stuff. Just go on the website and write.

## Why did you make this?
The motivation for neverending poem was to explore proof of work as a mechanism to prevent spamming.
When someone proposes a new paragraph for the neverending poem, that someones browser first performs some amount of work
before the paragraph is allowed to be added.

In that sense the neverending poem is kind of like a blockchain (but not really).

## Where can I find it?
Right now, it's just in this GitHub repo but maybe in the future I'll host it on Heroku or something. Or you can :)

## Well then how can I try it out?
Just clone the repo and run `npm install && npm build` followed by `npm start`.
